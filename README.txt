First Come First Serve Scheduling Algorithm

Aim:
The aim of this project is to develop a Python program on FCFS scheduling algorithm which accepts the user input such as the process id, execution time and arrival time. 

Outcomes:
1)Drawing the Gantt chart for the given input with FCFS algorithm.
2)Calculating the waiting time of each process.
3)Calculating the average waiting time.
4)Calculating the turn around time of each process.
5)Calculating average turn around time.

How to use the program:
Two program files(FCFS1.py and FCFS2.py) which works on FCFS concepts are given. Just install everything that is mentioned in the Install.txt.
Then use the code from any one of the two program files.
Both the code produces the given outcomes perfectly but the concept of coding differs from each other.
FCFS1.py will produce output with the gantt chart and FCFS2.py will produce output without the gantt chart
